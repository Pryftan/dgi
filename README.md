DGI Engine

The DGI engine supports the specific style of escape-the-room prerendered adventure game I'm looking to release over the coming months. It was developed in Swift 4.0 in Xcode 10.

Version 1 contains my initial approach to creating a game engine while I learned Swift; it is here for archival purposes. Version 2 is the current implementation and has been completely rewritten to better utilize Swift features. More detail is included in both READMEs.

DGI stands for Dentate Gyrus Industries, a fictional corporation developing direct neural interface technology primarily for healing patients suffering from brain injury or dementia, but also exploring enhanced interrogation and personality alteration. It was founded in the near future by Dr. Jules Cohle.
