DGI Engine

The DGI engine supports the specific style of escape-the-room prerendered adventure game I'm looking to release over the coming months. It was developed in Swift 4.0 in Xcode 10.

Version 1 contains my initial approach to creating a game engine while I learned Swift; it is here for archival purposes. Version 2 is the current implementation and has been completely rewritten to better utilize Swift features. More detail is included in both READMEs.
